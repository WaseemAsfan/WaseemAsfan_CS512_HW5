since I have decided to stick with this donut idea throughout the course, I
wanted to share what my original motivation was for making this donut scene.
When I first learned how to use blender, about 3 years ago, I started with 
a donut tutorial made by the youtube channel "Blender Guru". Its a very
popular tutorial and in the end I created a nicely animated donut scene which
I have included in the folder. When I started with webgl I wanted to try and
remake the same scene but without the same luxuries that is provided by blender.
